Both statuses are automatically transferred to other enemies on death unless consumed by {sinner:4}.",

Sub-targets will receive 50% damage and the main target will receive 200% damage if it's the only target.",
      "She gains {status:GazePersonality} when her S3-2 consumes the debuffs: 1 stack for every 2 {status:GazeRyoshu} and 3 stacks for every {status:ContemptRyoshu}. If you want to trigger her combo with {identity:10113}, you'll need her to gain 7 stacks. She's limited to only generating 6 stacks per turn this way, so you'll need to use {ego:20407} to cover the missing stacks.",
      "{status:GazePersonality} increases her damage for a turn. If she has 7, it converts to {status:ContemptPersonality} the following turn. This drastically reduces her damage dealt and taken for that turn, but if {identity:10113} uses his S3, he gets a free cast of {sinner:4}'s S4, which is a similar skill to his S3, but targeting {sinner:4} instead.",
      "She can also force herself to gain {status:ContemptPersonality} by using her defense skill if the enemies have enough of the statuses. She also gets it the first time she's staggered."
