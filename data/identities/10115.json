      "After using his first Furioso-Replica or being staggered, he unstaggers and replaces his {status:BurningWoundYisangMask} with {status:BurningWoundYisang} further reducing damage taken from unopposed attacks and increasing the damage of his {status:SuperCoin}s. It also gives him 1 {status:Combustion} and {status:Laceration} per turn.

      "Failing to follow the prescript gives him {status:KarmaOfIndexAlly}, a stacking debuff that makes him more fragile, weakens his base attacks, and lasts for the rest of the encounter. He stops gaining more of it when he hits 9 {status:BlessingOfIndexPrescriptAlly}.",

He also gains an additional 1 {status:StackYisangSpecialSkill} when using marked skills even without his passive.",
      "He can force his {status:BlessingOfIndexPrescriptAlly} and {status:UnlockBuff_Base} level to go up by using his defense at the cost of gaining {status:KarmaOfIndexAlly} stacks. You may want to use it in unfocused encounters since it immediately brings him up to {status:UnlockBuffAlly_2} which can take a while if you can't control whether he hits the marked enemy.",
      "{status:StackYisangSpecialSkill} can only be gained up to {status:UnlockBuff_Base} Stage + 2 per turn (5 per turn at max). Using Furioso-Replica can give him some {status:StackYisangSpecialSkill} back on the following turn. This counts towards the 5 cap of that turn, so you won't be able to build {status:StackYisangSpecialSkill} back up that quickly."
